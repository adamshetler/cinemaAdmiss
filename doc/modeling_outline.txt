Modeling: 

	Use features from each movie to predict Gross$ for future movies (regression). First transform Gross$ using log.
The data is time sensitive (i.e. some movies come before.. some after) therefore when training/validating our model I must 
train on the earliest movies then validate only on movies that come after the movies the model is trained on. 

		1. Simple Linear Regression (L1/L2) --- verify all 4 linearity asuumptions 
		2. SVM 
		3. Random Forest 
		4. GBM 
		5. Mixture Model (Gaussian)
		6. Gaussian Process
